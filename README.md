# Fake-news-detection
Built a ML model that detects whether the news is real or fake.I used TfidfVectorizer on the dataset to have a count on number of times a word appears in a document and used Passive aggressive classifier for correct classification outcome and it turns aggressive in the event of miscalculation and false counts.
